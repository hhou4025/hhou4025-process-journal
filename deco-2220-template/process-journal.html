                <p>To gain an understanding of what this process journal actually entails, it should first be clarified what the purpose of this project is. The objective of the initial design challenge was to develop an interface that would allow a user to interact with an autonomous vehicle.

Obviously, this is quite a general goal, however this allowed our group to refine and explore very specific contexts surrounding this challenge. The very first step upon commencement of this project was to select the autonomous vehicle we would be designing for. While we were initially intrigued by the application of automating civil vehicles, we found this might be a complex area to excel in. Originally our first area of interest was snowploughs. We thought this was an interesting area for automation given the essential industrial application of these vehicles in cold areas of the world. However, this area was quickly dismissed from our consideration after we realised how difficult it would be to find research participants that actually pertain to these vehicles, especially within Australia.

Our next two areas of consideration were agricultural and military vehicles. We played with the idea of military vehicles since one member of our group has direct experience with them and was able to get unique access to these vehicles and their operators. While the application of these vehicles was extremely interesting, particularity in an autonomous context, we concluded that it would probably be too complex to continue, given the controversial nature of the area and other security concerns about documenting these vehicles.</p>

  </div>

</div>

  <p>Finally, we settled on the agricultural vehicle sector. This area covers a range of vehicles such as trucks, tractors, ploughs and a range of others. We decided on this sector because we thought it would be an opportunity to explore a range of complex challenges for farmers such as labour, time management and process efficiency. Now that our vehicle area was covered, we commended our research. Sequentially we began with secondary research to gain a foundational understanding of the area we would be designing for.</p>

                <p>Now that we had an introductory understanding of the agricultural sector it was then imperative that we began gathering insights from the users of these vehicles. We wanted to gain a wide selection of users to interpret, however we narrowed down what kinds of people we wanted to interview directly. These were: current farmers, secondary framers, farm workers/assistants, previous farmers, future framers and interested individuals. Now that we had established the basic parameters for our research we then split up to conduct individual research.</p>

<p>Firstly, I conducted web survey utilising google forms. The purpose of this survey was to gather a large volume of data, particularly quantifiable stats about farm vehicle usage and autonomous technologies. I structured most of the questions so that they had definite answers e.g. yes or no. However, I also included some questions with open ended responses in order to gauge some very basic user insights and awareness into the issues currently facing farmers.

                <p>Having conducted all my primary interviews, along with the rest of my research, I could begin to consolidate my data and analyse it. Conducting the interviews wasn’t too challenging however organising them proved quite difficult since our group was looking at a very specific demographic, farmers, that typically don’t reside in cities. Although it proved difficult, I still managed to gather extensive insights from their interview sessions. As explained prior, all the interviews were conducted separate of each other to prevent participants being influenced by the responses of others.

The responses I received highlighted a range of different considerations for the design phase. The biggest takeaway from this session would be the overwhelming need to tracking and monitoring features. This explicit demand is due to the responsibility these vehicles will have in maintaining these people’s sources of income. Unlike transport or deliver autonomous vehicles, farm vehicles are integral to the business process on farms.

                <p>This week was primarily spent translating our research findings into design concepts. Our group was trying to avoid the trap of coming up with a really cool aesthetic design that doesn’t entirely relate to our user needs. While we had many ideas for interface, it was imperative that we were always ensuring the was a prevalent user need for each design choice. Rather than debate the intricacies of a singular vehicle interaction, we decided to brainstorm three primary concepts, each of which was centred around a different vehicle; aerial drone, tractor and ground rover.</p>

                </div><p> Each of these vehicles addressed different aspects of farming requirements, however our research indicated a tractor would be the most useful, but we wanted to experiment with the other concepts in order to gauge the effectiveness of our interactions.

The main features we knew that needed to be incorporated were motoring and tracking functions. We started sketching possible controls for this in the form of maps, cameras and charts. As shown in the iterations below basic screens were explored first so we could develop our concepts based on the ease of navigation between the main features.

                <p>The first concept was highly iterated at this stage. We had also begun more foundational steps for our other two concepts as well. Part of the first iteration was ensuring that we identified the main features users would be able to interact with. For our first concept these features were: Home screen, task progress, setting new tasks, live tracking and emergency vehicle settings. The next important part of our iterations was making sure we developed a highly accessible primary navigation. The main idea was to have all the main features readily available to the user on the home screen so that the transition to features was as simple as possible.

As seen in some of the sketches for the first concept we shifted from using a traditional scroll menu to a more centric display. Whilst this was only a minor change, we informed our decision from basic user testing. We didn’t go through full testing, but simply got basic feedback and suggestions each time we made a potentially significant design change that didn’t affect the concept overall. Once we developed our 1st iterations into fleshed-out designs for each concept, it was time to start preparing official user testing. We wanted this to be as succinct and direct as possible in order to gather very quick information on the designs.

Basic evaluations suggested we had some issues with balancing out all the different functions available within each concept. For the first concept, we regularly adjusted the home screen based on feedback, the main iterations occurred around the primary navigation and screen layouts.

                <p>Following the basic iteration, we completed, it was now time to start doing proper evaluation testing with users. We conducted the first round of prototype testing with each user individually since the usage of this interface would likely be a solitary task. The first prototypes we presented to each user were made of physical paper. For concepts 1 and 3 we created the prototypes as standard smart phone, while the second concept was made as an iPad template. We did this so we could get feedback on whether or not screen size would have an effect on the functionality of our interfaces.</p>

                </div>
<p>To begin the testing, we simply told users to explore the application first, verbally guiding them through the interactions. Whenever a user wanted to try an interaction we would then tell them what screen they would need to go to next. This was an efficient way for us to identify any outstanding issues with the core designs on each concept. Doing this alerted us to some difficulties determining what buttons were, but we attributed this to it being a low fidelity prototype. After this experimentation, we told users to complete a simple task.</p>
<div class="images-pj">
  <img src="./img/process-journal/paper.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
  <span class="img-caption">Paper Prototype Example</span>
</div>
<p> For the first concept, we asked users to go to the tracking section and locate the liver camera feature. This proved relatively easy, however there were a few moments where we were required to interfere and assist the user. This meant we would have to iterate the design of some of the buttons. For the second concept, the drone idea, users found completing the relatively straight forward task of activating the drone to be quite simple. This was primarily due to the concept having significantly less features when compared to the first concept. The drone controls only allowed the user to activate it, return it and visualise data. Users were really intrigued by the way data was presented to them. Especially having the multiple forms of data displayed on one of the screens. Obviously, this indicated that there was a pressing desire to have efficient data visualisation as a core component of our final design. The third concept provided very similar insights to what we received during the testing of the second concept. This was because in part, the core functions were very similar, however they revolved around different vehicles. Having gathered this foundational information from our sessions we then returned to iterating the concepts again. For the first concept we reimagined the primary navigation, transforming it to a horizontal scroll and for the other two concepts we tried new data displays and more prevalent nav controls like back buttons.

                  <p>Having reworked a number of features across our concepts, it was now time to test them again on our users. Since we had slightly increased the fidelity following feedback, we once again used paper prototypes but displayed them using the marvel testing app. This would simulate a more realistic experience of utilising our interface on a mobile device.  For the first concept, we were really interested to see how our redesigned primary navigation would work out for our users. Upon testing, it became apparent how difficult it was to convey the effect of this new navigation. We found that since we were unable to animate the navigation, the interaction of swiping left and right proved slightly more complex than we anticipated for the users. After explaining how it was meant to appear, the user’s reactions changed significantly. They much more receptive of the idea and were intrigued by it. This was an example of a key design choice being restricted by the prototyping tools made available to us. Based on this feedback we decided that this general navigation design would be our best way of proceeding when we come to the final design concept. With our drone concept, users once again voiced their appreciation of the readily available data visualisations. One point of key feedback we received was that the monitoring features should be expanded in order to offer a wide variety of display options for the user.

                <p>During this week, we finalised our testing. We decided not to continue with our third concept in the final round of testing because we believed we had gained sufficient feedback during our previous testing. One of the main reasons for this were that it was very similar in nature to our second concept, so any refinements would essentially be paralleled in that design too. We decided that we would take the data presentation component, which visualises a topographic heat map for the user, into our final design. Now that we were only evaluating two concepts, the preferred feedback was now centred around which concept offered the greatest overall experience in comparison. For the first concept, we were only really testing minor refinements since the prior feedback was so extensive. Such items we added to the design was a side menu for secondary navigation. This small addition allowed users to move between screens in a more conventional way along with being faster to jump across screens further apart on the horizontal wheel. While users still found the second concept to be highly accessible and pleasing to use, the overall consensus was that concept 1 was far more desirable in its functions and total offerings. Another resonating factor was that users said that a tractor was likely to be employed much more regularly than a surveillance drone. As a result of this combined feedback, along with stronger heuristic evaluation results, our group decided to pursue concept 1 as our main design. We would also incorporate elements from the other two concepts that users found desirable. We developed this concept into a set of annotated wireframes then from here we developed a user flow diagram, which illustrated the way users move and interact between screens.

    <p>Following the presentation of our results, we then commenced the high-fidelity prototyping stage. The first task was developing high quality mock-ups that we could then use as asset files within our designated prototyping tool. We created these mock-ups using adobe illustrator because it is a vastly more extensive and superior program to sketch. Once they were done, the next challenge was settling on a prototyping tool. While there were many interesting options available such as invison, pop, framer, etc., we decided to use a program could principle. Since our design incorporates unique animations as part of its main interaction, it was therefore essential we utilised a program capable of demonstrating those features. Principle allowed us to develop basic animations that conveyed the key functionality of our product. We created working screens for all the main interactions that a user would encounter when utilising our interface. Below is a quick example of how our prototype actually works.

    <p>Overall, we believe that we managed to achieve our goal of creating an interface that allowed farmers to utilise their time more effectively. While there are so many variables and small nuances involved with a project like this there are definitely things we thought went well and certainly some things that we could have done more effectively. One aspect we would like to have done more of through our project is user testing. Trying to gather a large number of farmers for testing proved quite difficult, especially at such short notice without any incentives either. Apart from these limitations, the project felt very successful from our point of view. We were able
